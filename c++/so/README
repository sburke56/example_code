Shared & Static Library Template

This is a template for a library that is built as 
both a static library & a shared object using scons.  
There is a makefile directory that contains the original file 
that compiles the library on linux & windows with mingw.  Those 
were'nt updated from the original download since I chose to use 
scons. 

Build Instructions 

* scons -f sconscript_lib
  -- This builds both the static library & the shared object. 
  -- Modify the LIBS line in the sconscript_main file to 
     specify what library you want to link to.  Either the 
     static or shared version.  

* scons -f sconscript_main
