Dynamically loading a dll/so at runtime.

This is a template for a library that is built as
a shared object using scons.  The so can be used as
the base class for a plugin that would be dynamically
loaded at runtime.  There are two stubs that need to
be exported from every plugin, create_object &
destroy_object.  Those functions allow for an intance
of the so to be created and then the public interface
can be used.

Build Instructions

* scons -f sconscript_lib
  -- This builds both the shared object.

* scons -f sconscript_main
  -- This builds the main executable that uses the shared object at
     runtime
  -- The path to the so needs to be specified on LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH):/path/to/so
