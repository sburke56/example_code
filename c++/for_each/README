for_each and bind2nd example 

This example illustrates the use of for_each to iterate through stl
containers.  It's much cleaner than using a for loop and declaring
iterators & puts the logic in it's own function.  You can use the
binders bind1st and bind2nd to bind parameters to be passed to the
function used by for_each.
