This program illustrates how you can embed a Lua interpreter into a
C/C++ program.  The C program goes ahead and loads up a .lua file and
then tells the interpreter to run the .lua file.

The command line parameters to this program are .lua files which are
run by the C program.  Included in this directory is a hello.lua file
which prints out hello world to the screen.
