Elegant Command Line Parsing

This is a program that illustrates the usage of the boost
program_options library.  It allows you to handle command line
arguments as well as a run control file of some type with
configuration options in there as well.  This sample only illustrates
the command line portion of it.  To build it you will need to build
the boost library program_options.  Build instructions are below.

The program is setup up where a struct with all public static methods
contains any functions related to parsing the command line and then
once that is done the static variable g_vm (Variable Map) & g_desc
(Description) can be used.  Other classes wanting to use the variable
map could declare the variable extern so they wouldn't have to include
the command_line_utils header.

Build Instructions

      boost
      *  download the source distribution to ~/boost
      *  ./bootstrap.sh 
      *  ./bjam --with-libraries=program_options --prefix=<alternate location>
      *  ./bjam install 

      main
      * scons
