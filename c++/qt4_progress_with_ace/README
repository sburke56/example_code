This is a dialog using qt4.  It has a button called Show Progress that
spawns a thread which takes a while.  During that time it sends out
progress events so the main dialog can update a progress bar.  This
example uses ACE_Thread_Manager to spawn the thread with a static
member function as the thread's main function.  It uses QAppliction
postEvent since sendEvent seemed like it was being called from the
thread but also run in that thread and that won't work since it's
touching gui elements.  This didn't seem to be the case when I was
using a QThread derived class and send events from it with sendEvent.
I haven't done the tests yet to confirm what was happening.
