This sample makes use of the boost regex library.  It allows you to
perform regular expression matching similar to the grep/sed/awk
utilities.  The typedef regex & wregex are used to specify the regex
which is used in the same fasion as a std::string.  The function
regex_match will find matches that consume the entire input text,
where regex_search will find any matches within the input text.
match_results is used to get the text that was matched by the regular
expression.
