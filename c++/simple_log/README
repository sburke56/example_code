This is a simple logging class that has only one header to include.
It can log to stdout or you specify a file for the log messages to be
written to.  There are two compilation flags that are mentioned in the
test main.cpp that govern the ouput of the logging in the compiled
program.

The main.cpp is an example program using log.h.  After running it the
log file should be in the current directory with a name
application.log.
